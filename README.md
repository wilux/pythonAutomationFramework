Prerequisites:
This automation framework requires the following tools:

Python 3.9 or above: Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Behave: A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for Python. Install using pip install behave.
Allure: A reporting framework for generating comprehensive test reports. Install using pip install allure-behave.
Running Tests:
To execute the example test, use the following command:

Bash
behave -D browser=firefox -D option=--headless tests/features/open_website.feature
Usa el c贸digo con precauci贸n.
content_copy
Explanation:

behave: Invokes the Behave test runner.
-D browser=firefox: Specifies the browser to use. Supported options include firefox, chrome, opera, and edge. Default is firefox.
-D option=--headless: Runs the browser in headless mode (no visible window). Omit this option for a visible browser window.
tests/features/open_website.feature: Path to the feature file containing the test scenario.
Reporting:
Allure Reports:

The framework generates Allure reports in the allure.output directory. To view these reports, run the following command:

Bash
allure serve allure.output
Usa el c贸digo con precauci贸n.
content_copy
This will open a web browser with the generated Allure report.

JUnit Reports:

The framework also generates JUnit reports in the reports directory. These reports are compatible with Jenkins and other CI/CD tools.

Note:
This is a basic automation framework that can be expanded upon as needed. It provides a solid foundation for building comprehensive test suites using Behave and Allure.
